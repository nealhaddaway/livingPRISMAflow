Description: Produce flow diagrams that are compliant with the 
    PRISMA 2020 reporting standards for living systematic reviews 
    (LSR). LSRs are regularly updated evidence syntheses that require 
    specific visualisations of the flow diagrams to demonstrate both 
    original (base) and incremental flows of evidence through the 
    methodological pipeline from identification, through screening, 
    to a final set of included studies. Data are read in using the 
    function `LSRPrisma_data()` from a standard template (e.g. 
    'inst/extdata/approach1.csv'). Data should be entered into this 
    template with each incremental value or update stored as a separate 
    column. The function `LSRPrisma_flow()` then produces a flow 
    diagram with each column presented in a table within each box. 
    Users can choose to include 'previous' and 'other' sources of 
    studies.
